Skeletest
=========

Skeletest is an experiment using PEG.js to parse language describing UnitTest files skeletons that will be available as templates to kickstart adding tests on classes. It parses the language using PEG.js to generate a JSON object which is then fed to a Handlebar template to produce the skeleton of the testing class
